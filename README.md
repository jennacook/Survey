# Survey

Survey / Feedback requests on TOPdesk tickets to identify the performance and capture suggestions or comments from our customers. 

Present Day: 
10 days after a TOpdesk Incident ticket is completed, the requestor will receive an email "How did we do?"
The email will link to their TOPdesk ticket where the customer can rate the service 1 - 5 stars. 
Comments can be added to the feedback. 

Desirable: 
More open questions.
Survey immediately after ticket is completed.
Ability to report on metrics and see metrics for regions and teams, and report on trending.

Note:
The survey/feedback we use today uses TOPdesks standard feedback feature.
